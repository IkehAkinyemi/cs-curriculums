# Computer Science Learning Curricula

## Overview
This repository contains structured learning curricula for various Computer Science topics I've deeply explored. By open-sourcing these curricula, I aim to provide others with well-organized learning paths that combine theoretical foundations with practical implementations.

## Currently Available Curricula

### Data Structures and Algorithms (15 weeks)
A comprehensive curriculum covering fundamental to advanced topics including:
- Algorithm analysis and complexity theory
- Core data structures and their implementations
- Advanced algorithms and problem-solving techniques
- Practical projects and real-world applications
- Performance optimization and analysis

## Structure
Each curriculum follows a consistent format:
- Clear learning objectives
- Structured weekly content
- Hands-on programming projects
- Problem sets and exercises
- Assessment methodologies
- Implementation examples in Go

## How to Use This Repository

### For Self-Learners
- Follow the weekly structure at your own pace
- Complete programming projects to reinforce learning
- Use problem sets for practice
- Adapt the assessment sections for self-evaluation

### For Study Groups
- Use the curriculum as a roadmap for group learning
- Leverage project specifications for team exercises
- Conduct peer reviews using provided criteria
- Hold regular discussion sessions on theoretical concepts

### For Educators
- Adapt the curriculum for classroom use
- Utilize provided assessment structures
- Modify projects for different class sizes
- Incorporate additional exercises as needed

## Prerequisites
