   - Code editor/IDE
   - Version control system
   - Testing framework

### For Group Study
1. **Organization**
   - Form 3-5 person groups
   - Assign weekly roles (leader, reviewer, etc.)
   - Schedule regular meetups

2. **Activities**
   - Code reviews
   - Problem-solving sessions
   - Project collaborations
   - Mock interviews

3. **Collaboration Tools**

   - Final presentations

## Adaptation Guidelines

### For Different Programming Languages
- Core concepts remain same
- Adjust implementation examples
- Consider language-specific features
- Modify performance considerations

### For Different Time Constraints
- **Shorter Duration**
  - Focus on core concepts
  - Combine related topics
  - Reduce project scope
  - Streamline assessments

- **Extended Duration**
  - Add advanced topics
  - Include more projects
  - Deeper algorithm analysis
  - Additional practice problems

## Support and Resources
